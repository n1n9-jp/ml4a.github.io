if you torture the data long enough, it will confess

animals are without feeling or awareness of any kind?

But the greatest of all the prejudices we have retained from infancy is that of believing that brutes think

the soul of the brute is of the same nature as our own

Rene Descartes, "Animals are machines"

 

The celebrated polymath Rene Descartes is known for -- among other things -- his dualistic philosophy which held that body and mind are ontologically distinct entities. The mind (or "soul") is the incorporeal seat of consciousness, rationality, and emotion. Besides for being separate from body, minds are unique to human beings, according to Descartes, and therefore animals ("brutes"), being purely of mechanical composition are "machines" which lack the ability to perceive pain. Thus, he advocated live dissection for science and other practices regarded centuries later as cruel, and believed harming animals was of no moral consequence (unless it encroached on another human being). The protesting cry of an animal is no different from a "[whining gear that needs oil.](http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1359_reg.html"

Of course, few people needed a philosophical justification to practice bull-baiting, ___, and other such activities. But an animal rights movement fomented only after the emergence of the view that animals were not categorically distinct from human beings. After all, animals seek food and warmth, recoil from pain, quaver in fear, compete for resources and practice self-preservation. Our ability to empathize with animals comes from this tendency to exhibit faculties we see in ourselves.

As contemporary machines continue to acquire more of the traits we once associated only with "organic" beings, Hollywood movies like Her and Ex Machina have played on this tendency.

 But in Descartes time, the notion was widespread. No animal rights groups existed to protest practices like vivisection, bull-baiting, and other abuses.

This chapter will address the various and numerous sociocultural implications surrounding artificial intelligence and machine learning, including ethical and political considerations. It will be mostly a big survey of these, and may be broken out into smaller chapters in the future.

# Increasing pervasiveness of machine intelligence

...but AI systems are widespread now and already, problems which most of the ill-informed movies ignore. There are _already_ clear and present dangers, and issues we are increasingly confronting. 

...rethinking their strategies, which means many complex decisions will be sorted out in the near future.

In personal communications, we are all familiar with spam filters. But as Google and other companies begin rolling out products like Inbox, we are seeing machine intelligence take up e-mail and communications organization more generally, by offering to sort and group your e-mail according to subject analysis. This is already done, not without controversy, in the retail and commercial sectors where products and inventories are organized by algorithms. With interpersonal communications, these questions persist and hit closer to home.

Questions like:


 - When these algorithms are permitted to scan our e-mails, what else do they use the analysis for? Do they store the results, do they share them, do they sell them?
 - These algorithms affect which of our e-mails we are more likely to see than other ones. How do they make such discriminations? Knowing that setting them up in different ways may sort them differently, how do we decide one method vs another.

Like in the trolley problem, there are no obvious solutions to these, partly because they are subjective questions. So how are these decisions arrived at? We've seen that various settings and free parameters, and certainly entire architectures have enormous influence on the behavior of these algorithms. Which of these levers are exposed to the user, and which are conveniently automated? How much agency does the user have with respect to that question? 

There is a conflict of interest inherent in the last problem. Other entities have a stake in these decisions, in addition to the user. Are some topics favored against others?

# The trolley problem and the issue of agency

There is an old __ . A more concrete example of this is the Google driverless car -- forced to make a decision who to kill, how does it decide? These are questions with no obvious answers, and even fewer explicit legal frameworks exist to answer them.  many have made much commentary about it.

# Diversity in research and adjacent fields

The research sector in AI and machine learning suffers from what plagues many fields more generally, particularly the overall field of computer science.

# Rights of man, rights of machine?

If you think these questions are overly speculative, long shots, or far off, I invite you to watch to view the robot from the Boston Dynamic group Robot. try to watch this without having feelings

As machines demonstrate more autonomy, can they act out of self-preservation? Nature shows us that self-preservation is a helpful instinct to have and thus selected for it. Will humans, in order to make machines more effective, select for self-preservational qualities? If they begin to clamor for more support, how will we react?

# Meta-ethics

These questions are relevant even to the design of this book! Certain technical features are encapsulated and hidden for the sake of accessibility. Does it encourage reductionist thinking?

these are the sorts of issues movies like Her and Ex Machina
play to, but there are numerous issues to contend ith

if you're skeptical that we'll have a rights movement for robots, remember that descartes said beasts (animals) had no conciousness/were automatons, ergo you can harm them
