A _neural network_ is a data structure composed of [neurons](/glossary/neuron/) which is commonly used in machine learning. Neural networks are usually arranged as a sequence of _layers_ whose neurons connect to each other. An example of a 2-layer neural network is shown below, having 3 neurons in its _input layer_, 1 neuron in its _output layer_, and 2 neurons in its single _hidden layer_.

Neural networks are _mathematical functions_, in that they model a functional relationship between an input vector and an output vector. The function is parameterized by a set of _weights_ on each connection. The actual values of the weights are _learned_ through the process of _training_ the neural network, during which a _training algorithm_ is used to determine a set of weights for which the network accurately models a known data set.

Neural networks are the most widely used algorithms in _deep learning_ and come in many forms. A more thorough explanation of basic neural networks can be found in the chapter [neural networks](/ml4a/neural_networks/), as well as subsequent ones.
