<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p/>
ml4a.github.io is an in-development book about machine learning, being written by <a href="http://www.genekogan.com">Gene Kogan</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/genekogan">@genekogan</a>) and <a href="http://frnsys.com/">Francis Tseng</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/frnsys">@frnsys</a>). Expected first draft: <strike>March</strike> <strike>May</strike> <strike>June</strike> <strike>August 2016</strike> <b>early-2017</b>.
<p/>
<i>Why the delays?</i> The delays in the release schedule can be attributed to two factors.
<ul>
	<li><b>Changes in scope:</b> initially, ml4a was to be a collection of reading materials for a <a href="/classes/itp-S16">single class</a>, and now seeks to be more broadly useful, necessitating the development of new features and chapters. Over time, <a href="/demos">Demos</a> and <a href="/guides">Guides</a> were elevated from supporting materials to the book into full-fledged sections of their own.</li>
	<li><b>The goalposts keep moving:</b> since the initial version of this page went up, we've seen <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234">AlphaGo</a>, the <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/04/announcing-tensorflow-08-now-with.html">announcement of TensorFlow</a>, <a href="http://www.evolvingai.org/synthesizing">deep generator nets</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">synthetic gradients</a>, <strike><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04062v1">stacked approximate regression machines</a></strike>, and many other major milestones in the field. To keep ml4a contemporary, we have to learn how to keep up with the field.</li>
</ul>
<p/>
Draft chapters may be viewed <a href="index/">here</a>. Some are nearly complete, some are very rough, some are just stubs. <a href="/guides">Guides</a> and <a href="/demos">Demos</a> are being released as we go.
